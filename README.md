# Turnip Exchange Tool

## Current State
Have an alpha version built that collects data and stores it in a sqlite3 database.

I'd like to compile this information every <insert interval here> and start coming up with some algorithms to determine best value, best speed/availablity, and the ability to launch your browser to the queue using the turnip code.

## TODO
* Verify that the response returns with 200
* Remove cookie uuid and put into config file
* Check the response header for time field that says how often it will take requests
